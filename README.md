## Project Title: Secure Spring Boot Application with JWT Authentication

### Project Overview:

<h5> <i>This project is a Spring Boot application designed to demonstrate secure RESTful API development using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization. The primary goal of the project is to implement robust security measures while providing a seamless user experience for authentication and access control.</i></h5>

### Key Features:

- User Registration and Login:
Users can register by providing their details, which are securely stored in the database.
Upon successful registration, users can log in to the system using their credentials.
JWT Generation and Validation:

- After logging in, the application generates a JWT token, which is sent back to the client.
The token is signed with a secret key and includes user information and expiration time.
Subsequent requests to protected endpoints must include this token for validation.
Role-Based Access Control:

- The application supports role-based access control, allowing different user roles (e.g., ADMIN, USER) to access specific resources.
Authorization checks are performed based on the userâ€™s role embedded in the JWT.
Secure RESTful APIs:

- All sensitive API endpoints are secured and require a valid JWT token for access.
The application handles unauthorized access attempts and returns appropriate HTTP status codes.
Exception Handling:

- Custom exception handling is implemented to provide meaningful error messages for authentication and authorization failures.
Security Best Practices:

### The application follows security best practices, including password hashing, token expiration, and secure storage of sensitive information.
Technologies Used:

- Spring Boot 6
- Spring Security 3
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- MySQL Database (optional, can change to any other database)
- Maven for dependency management
Conclusion: This project serves as a comprehensive guide for implementing secure authentication in Spring Boot applications using JWT. It showcases how to protect RESTful APIs effectively and provides a solid foundation for building secure web applications.
